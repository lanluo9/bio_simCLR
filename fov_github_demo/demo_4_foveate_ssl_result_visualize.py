"""Here we provide all our training and evaluation curves used in the paper. Since there are too many experiments, here are some useful regex filters you can paste into tensorboard to view them.

* `eval_fov` Batch of experiments testing foveation transform as adaptive blur. (**Experiment 1**)
  * Specifically, look for the the runs without crop `eval_fov_nocrop` vs others `eval_fov_[^nocrop]`
* `eval_magnif_[^sal]` Batch of experiments testing foveation as cortical magnification. (**Experiment 2**)
  * Specifically, look at `eval_magnif_bsl` the baseline setting. 
  * `eval_magnif_cvr_0_05-0_35_[^K]+$` for our best cortical magnification parameters. 
* `eval_sal_new_T[\d\.]*_Oct0[5]` One batch of experiments testing temperature effect on saliency based cropping (**Experiment 3**)
* `eval_sal_new_T[\d\.]*_Oct0[89]` Another batch of experiments testing temperature effect on saliency based cropping (**Experiment 3**)
* `eval_magnif_salmap_[T[\d_]*|flat]_` Batch of experiments testing temperature effect of saliency based cortical magnification (**Experiment 4**)
